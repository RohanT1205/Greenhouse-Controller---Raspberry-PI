Greenhouse Controller that allows users to view real-time sensor readings of the current temperature, pressure and humidity. These readings are shown on
screen in the form of a thermostat, but also on the Raspberry PI itself with a bar graph. The bar graph displays three green bars and a purple square. The green bars displays the 
current temperature, humidity, and pressure, from left to right, and the purple squares on the temperature and humidity bars represent the setpoints, or the target values.
